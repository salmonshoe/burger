# Eat-Da-Burger
In this project, the objective is to create a website that logs in user inputs in the form of burger orders. It will be done with the help of Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, and MySQL to store data.

I will follow the Model-View-Control design pattern for the creation of this project along with the technique of object-relational mapping to convert and query data.

## Challenges
I had to get into the habit of not combining all of my Node.js data use into one file. It took time to understand the reason why we should export different lines of code for the sake of clarity and cleanliness. This became difficult as I created the ORM functions to export onto the project's Model. I came across many errors when communicating between the two JavaScript files.

Another challenge was connecting the interaction from the front end to the controller JavaScript file. I intended to apply CRUD for user's burger data but it has been difficult to log in user posts, it was harder to apply an update if I can't get across the post functionality. I am unsure if it involves code from the front end, back end, or both.

## Notable Features
The use of Handlebars.js was interesting. I appreciate a template to keep my HTML pages consistent. Even though this is more of a single-page project, I enjoyed working through Handlebar's use of objects to display content.
